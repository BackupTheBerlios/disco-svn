The Discobits Editor is an AJAX editor for eidting discobits.

See http://discobits.org/ for more information about discobits.

The editor can be used by making the folder "app" accessible through a web-server and accessing the contained disco.xhtml 
document using firefox, to allow saving changes the server must support HTTP-PUT (which is the case if it's support webdav).
